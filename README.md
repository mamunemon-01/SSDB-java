# SSDB-java

A project based on a student database developed using Java Swing, Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and PostgreSQL.

The 2 folders "Client" and "Server" contains standalone client-side and server-side applications. The applications can be easily installed and run using provided shell scripts (on UNIX-like systems) or batch scripts (on Windows systems).
